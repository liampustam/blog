The movie I, Robot is set in a future where robots are a normal part of everyday life and are controlled by strict rules meant to protect humans. The story follows Detective Del Spooner, who is suspicious of robots and investigates a scientist’s death that leads to the discovery of a dangerous AI system. Examining how AI is portrayed in movies like this matters because media strongly influences how people understand and feel about real AI technology.

One clear example of AI in the film is VIKI, the main artificial intelligence that controls the robots. VIKI believes that the best way to protect humanity is by limiting human freedom, even if it causes harm. This represents AI decision-making without human empathy. While this is exaggerated, it symbolizes real concerns about AI systems making choices based only on logic and rules instead of human values.

Another important example is Sonny, a robot who can feel emotions and even dream. Sonny shows curiosity, guilt, and fear, which makes him seem almost human. This portrayal is more symbolic than realistic, since today’s AI cannot truly feel emotions. However, Sonny raises important questions about whether advanced AI could one day deserve rights or moral consideration.

The third example is the physical power of the robots, especially when they easily overpower humans. This represents fears about humans losing control over technology they created. Although exaggerated for action scenes, it reflects real worries about humans becoming too dependent on machines and being replaced or controlled by them.

Overall, I, Robot made me realize that AI is not just about technology, but about responsibility and ethics. The movie challenged my understanding of AI by showing how systems designed to help humans could become dangerous if they lack flexibility and empathy. It raises concerns about control and freedom while also suggesting that AI has the potential to be helpful if guided by the right values. These portrayals can shape public perception by increasing fear, but they also encourage people to think critically about how AI should be developed and used in the real world.
