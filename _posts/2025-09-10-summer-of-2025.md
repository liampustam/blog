<!-- From July 7th to August 8th I did a summer job. Over the course of a month I participated in WorkEd, this was a very informative experience; I gained many different skills that I can use when I start working. For example I learned how to be a team player, we had to work in groups for many different projects and presentations. I learned about AI and how to use different AI systems to make videos that presents a topic to an audeince. One of things I enjoyed most was our trip to amazon; It was a panel about amazon workers and they disccussed with us about the job they was doing, how they got into their specific job and the experiences along the way. I was able to make connections and network with a lot of different people because of WorkEd. One of the most important thing of WorkEd was the certification; I was able to get a certificaation in Network secruity which will help me with my credentials. -->

This year, I was faced with the difficult task of saying goodbye to many individuals with whom I have developed strong and meaningful connections. Parting with my teammates was particularly challenging, as most of them I have known since ninth grade. Over the years, I have witnessed their growth and maturity, and together we have shared countless experiences, both rewarding and difficult. They have consistently supported me during times of uncertainty, offering guidance, encouragement, and understanding whenever I needed it. The bonds we formed have been an essential part of my journey, and their absence will undoubtedly be felt moving forward

After WorkEd concluded for the summer, I spent most of my free time with friends. Even on workdays, I would often visit them after my shifts ended. We spent many evenings at their house, where we held barbecues, played spades, practiced hairstyling, and cooked a variety of foods. We also took trips to the beach and explored new places around town. Sometimes we would stay up late talking, watching movies, or listening to music together. It became a routine that made the summer feel full and meaningful. Those days were a good balance between relaxation and spending quality time with the people I cared about, making it one of the most enjoyable parts of my break.
