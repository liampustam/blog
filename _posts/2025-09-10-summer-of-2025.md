This year was full of change and growth for me. One of the hardest things I had to do was say goodbye to many people who have been an important part of my life. Saying goodbye to my teammates was especially emotional because most of us have known each other since ninth grade. We spent so many hours together at practices, games, and team events, and over time, we became more like family than just teammates. I’ve seen everyone grow and improve both on and off the field. We supported each other through wins and losses, through good days and bad ones. They were always there when I needed advice, motivation, or someone to talk to. From them, I learned how powerful teamwork, friendship, and communication can be. Saying goodbye wasn’t easy, but it made me realize how much those relationships shaped who I am today. Even though we’re going our separate ways, I’ll always be thankful for the memories and lessons we shared.<p>

From July 7th to August 8th, I worked in the WorkEd program, which became one of the most valuable experiences of my summer. During that month, I learned a lot about the professional world and developed skills that I know will help me in the future. I learned how to work well with others by doing group projects and presentations, and I also practiced time management and leadership. One of the most interesting parts of WorkEd was learning about artificial intelligence and how to use different AI tools to make videos and presentations. It opened my eyes to how technology can be used creatively and professionally. A major highlight was our trip to Amazon. We attended a panel where Amazon workers shared their personal stories, talked about how they got their jobs, and explained what they do every day. Hearing their experiences helped me understand how important hard work and determination are when it comes to reaching your goals. I also made new connections and met people who gave me advice about my future. Earning my Network Security certification was another big accomplishment. It showed me that I’m capable of achieving more than I thought and gave me confidence in my ability to build a career in technology..</p>

After WorkEd ended, I spent the rest of my summer enjoying time with my friends. Even on workdays, I often went to their houses after my shifts to relax and have fun. We did so many things together—barbecues, spades games, cooking different foods, and practicing hairstyles. We also took trips to the beach, watched movies, and listened to music late into the night. These moments made the summer feel full and exciting. They reminded me how important it is to spend time with people who make you happy. It wasn’t just about having fun; it was about building memories that I’ll always look back on with gratitude. Those days taught me that taking time to relax and enjoy life is just as important as working hard.

Looking back, this year and summer helped me grow in many ways. I learned how to balance responsibility with fun, how to stay motivated, and how to appreciate the people in my life. I also gained confidence in myself—both in my ability to work with others and to face change. Saying goodbye to old friends, learning new skills through WorkEd, and spending time with people I care about all taught me that growth happens through every experience, whether big or small. I’m proud of how far I’ve come and excited to see what comes next.
