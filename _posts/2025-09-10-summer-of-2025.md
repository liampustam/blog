<!-- From July 7th to August 8th I did a summer job. Over the course of a month I participated in WorkEd, this was a very informative experience; I gained many different skills that I can use when I start working. For example I learned how to be a team player, we had to work in groups for many different projects and presentations. I learned about AI and how to use different AI systems to make videos that presents a topic to an audeince. One of things I enjoyed most was our trip to amazon; It was a panel about amazon workers and they disccussed with us about the job they was doing, how they got into their specific job and the experiences along the way. I was able to make connections and network with a lot of different people because of WorkEd. One of the most important thing of WorkEd was the certification; I was able to get a certificaation in Network secruity which will help me with my credentials. -->
